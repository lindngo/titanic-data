# Titanic Data Analysis


### Overview
In this Python file, I utilized pandas, matpotlib, and seaborn to analyze and visualize the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Specifically, I wanted to see which factors impacted the passengers' survival rate the most, as well as the least. Furthermore, I used various visualization techniques to create graphs of the data, including heatmaps, distribution plots, and bar plots.

I obtained this dataset here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zariable/data/master/titanic_train.csv. 

### Dataset Factors

- PassengerID: A column added by Kaggle to identify each row and make submissions easier
- Survived: Whether the passenger survived or not and the value we are predicting (0=No, 1=Yes)
- Pclass: The class of the ticket the passenger purchased (1=1st, 2=2nd, 3=3rd)
- Sex: The passenger's sex
- Age: The passenger's age in years
- SibSp: The number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard the Titanic
- Parch: The number of parents or children the passenger had aboard the Titanic
- Ticket: The passenger's ticket number
- Fare: The fare the passenger paid
- Cabin: The passenger's cabin number
- Embarked: The port where the passenger embarked (C=Cherbourg, Q=Queenstown, S=Southampton)
